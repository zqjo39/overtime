the project is this:
make a fully functioning "corporate" website

this will include:
- roles (custom is great, but storebought will do)
    - all the registering and logging in/out nonsense too
    - AND permissions
- places to enter data
    - to show up on charts and tables, mostly
        - CHARTS NEED COLOR-
- css for a fake website, go nuts
- pug/mixins for all purposes
    - previous projects should give an idea as what should be a mixin
- JAVASCRIPT
    - actually try to comprehend what the heck goes on in there
- tables to store data and ALL that entails
    - yes, that includes linking everything up

tools to help are:
- any past project
    - it's not plagiarism if you're stealing from yourself-
    - in all seriousness, you can pull from the more recent projects
- the web
    - like, seriously, just look things up, it's not that hard

to-do:
[] follow 6.3 (User Roles)
[] figure out finer details

- you got this :D
