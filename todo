the project is this:
make a fully functioning "corporate" website

this will include:
- roles (custom is great, but storebought will do)
    - all the registering and logging in/out nonsense too
    - AND permissions
- places to enter data
    - to show up on charts and tables, mostly
        - CHARTS NEED COLOR-
- css for a fake website, go nuts
- pug/mixins for all purposes
    - previous projects should give an idea as what should be a mixin
- JAVASCRIPT
    - actually try to comprehend what the heck goes on in there
- tables to store data and ALL that entails
    - yes, that includes linking everything up

effectively, just combine:
- user roles (6.3) (this will be the base for , as well as general project tone)
- employee manager (5.1) (CEO will have access to this, find out how to order from most to least powerful role, then last name a-z)
- bookstore (5.4) (just for the user page, for personal info and stuff for the CEO/admin to access)
- colorpicker (3.2) (& all of unit one, it's all charts) (for creating charts for possible presentations)
- blog (6.4) (chatroom for all employees, just articles from CEO/admin and commenting for everyone else (no replies?))???

tools to help are:
- any past project
    - it's not plagiarism if you're stealing from yourself-
    - in all seriousness, you can pull from the more recent projects
- the web
    - like, seriously, just look things up, it's not that hard

to-do:
[*] follow 6.3 (User Roles)
[*] figure out finer details
[] test register function
[] refine dashboard (add charts/ability to make charts)
[] remove role additions (register.pug)
[] find out how to get ceo/admin to promote/demote employees
[] add employee user pages

- you got this :D
